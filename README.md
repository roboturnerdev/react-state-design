# State Design Example

This is an example of state and props being delegated appropriately. The idea is to centralize the state with the parent component, and only pass down data to the child that is necessary as it is a display component.

Designing in this manner helps us satisfy the two design points discussed in the notes:

* Keep State Small

* Centralize State In Parent
